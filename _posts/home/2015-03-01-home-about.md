## about

#### me

- I am an audio developer enthusiast, based in Leuven, Belgium.
- when not working on audio stuff, I have a day job tending to a little but cool ISV startup, a modest IT consulting business and a family

#### mission

- mixing midi + plugins + crazy ideas
- learning music theory, mostly by trying to explain it to a machine
- share the <del>insane rubbish</del> awesome results with fellow enthusiasts

#### other projects

- not really audio-related, but [Tagwolf Email Filing Assistant](http://www.tagwolf.com) is major project I've been working on lately (now you know why tonespace updates take so long ;-).
- it applies smart classification algorithms to incoming email that can predict where your email should be filed - a big time saver for professionals that file their email to folders in Microsoft Outlook
