## what is tonespace?

- a chord generator and visualizer
- displays chords and scales on a grid, making it easy to understand their structure
- displays chords on a piano keyboard, making it easy to play them
- supports 39 chord types, 25 chord voicings/inversions, 21 scales, 18 keys, and 50 different grids
- accepts easy, single-note MIDI input for triggering or viewing chords
- can output chords over MIDI to your favorite synth
- acts either as a VST or Audio Unit plugin for your DAW, or as a standalone application

----

## how do I use it?

- audition and play chords while you move the mouse around in a grid-like space - or use a traditional MIDI keyboard instead
- learn how musical scales and keys work, and how chords relate to these, using the simple octave-based spaces
- discover how chords map onto surprisingly simple geometric shapes in the more advanced spaces
- use chord-generation algorithms to fit chords to scales and keys automatically
- trigger chords from monophonic midi input and record the played chords using midi output
