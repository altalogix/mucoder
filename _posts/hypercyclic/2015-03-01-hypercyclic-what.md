## what is hypercyclic?

- an LFO-driven MIDI arpeggiator, gate effect and step sequencer
- for mangling sustained MIDI input chords
- the output of which can then drive other MIDI instruments
- acts either as a VST or Audio Unit plugin for your DAW, or as a standalone application
- the original hypercyclic won 2nd place in the KVRAudio.com Developer Challenge '07
- the sweetspot for hypercyclic is the narrow border between chaos and regularity. Or, in other words, how to induce a certain pleasant randomness and syncopation, yet forcing everything to align again on the bar or beat boundaries

## how do you use it?

- the main use for hypercyclic is to generate midi that can be recorded and/or sent to other plugins. However it also features a simple built-in synth for testing purposes
- you can use two tempo-synced LFOs to modulate various parameters for creating interesting rhythmic effects and chord variations
- a unique feature is the possiblity to modulate the sequencer step size itself, which is useful for creating glitchy stuttering effects
- another thing you can use is a groove function for playing slightly off the beat. The groove parameters can also be modulated over time by the LFOs, adding to the rhythmic variation
