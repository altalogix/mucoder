pageDescription: "Hypercyclic is an LFO-driven MIDI arpeggiator, gate effect and step sequencer. It can be used for mangling sustained MIDI input chords, the output of which can then drive other MIDI instruments. Acts either as a VST or Audio Unit plugin for your DAW, or as a standalone application. The sweetspot for Hypercyclic is the narrow border between chaos and regularity. Or, in other words, how to induce a certain pleasant randomness and syncopation, yet forcing everything to align again on the bar or beat boundaries. The original Hypercyclic won 2nd place in the KVRAudio.com Developer Challenge."
