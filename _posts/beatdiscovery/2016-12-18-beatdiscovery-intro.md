If you make beats, then you’ve probably sifted through hundreds of sounds, loading them individually, only to program the same pattern you’ve made a thousand times.  It’s extremely tedious, and can take the fun out of making a beat.  Beat Discovery is the first drum sequencer of it’s kind, and was designed to solve this problem. It makes programming sounds fun, creative, and super easy. It’s easy for beginners & made for and by professionals.
