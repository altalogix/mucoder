this is the source code of the new  mucoder.net site
====================================================

# What?

It's based on the excellent jekyll template at (https://github.com/t413/SinglePaged).
The main difference with the SinglePaged theme is support for multiple pages, each of which can hold a number of posts.

Think of it as a tree of SinglePaged-type pages. This makes it more suitable for a product website,
with a different SinglePaged-type page for each product.

# Please note

- For now, this repository contains the **output** generated by Jekyll. Once the site is stable, I plan to publish the Jekyll source here as well - for anyone interested in forking it.
- The new mucoder site is still a work in progress and it's not recommended to link to it yet. Please visit (http:www.mucoder.net) if you want to see the existing site.
