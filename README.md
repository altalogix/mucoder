this is the source code of the new www.mucoder.net site
=======================================================

# What?

It's based on the excellent jekyll template at (https://github.com/t413/SinglePaged).
The main difference with the SinglePaged theme is 
- support for multiple pages, each of which can hold a number of posts
- based on latest version of Skeleton.js framework (sass version)
- now uses sass for css stylesheets
- added EU cookie law support (no guarantees though this solution is fully legally compliant!)

Think of it as a tree of SinglePaged-type pages. This makes it more suitable for a product website,
with a different SinglePaged-type page for each product.

# Please note

- The new mucoder site is still a work in progress and it's not recommended to link to it yet. Please visit (http:www.mucoder.net) if you want to see the existing site.
