this is the source code of the new www.mucoder.net site
=======================================================

# What?

It's based on the excellent Jekyll template at https://github.com/t413/SinglePaged.
The main difference with the SinglePaged theme is 
- support for multiple pages, each of which can hold a number of posts
- based on latest version of Skeleton.js framework (sass version)
- now uses sass for css stylesheets
- added EU cookie notice support (no guarantees though this solution is fully legally compliant!)
- added embedded RSS feed support
- added embedded twitter widget support with custom styling (customize-twitter.js)
- added 404 page

Think of it as a tree of SinglePaged-type sites. This makes it more suitable for a product website,
with a different SinglePaged-type page for each product.  Each such page can then set a group parameter, 
making it include only those posts that have the same group name set in their front-matter variables.


# Please note

- The new mucoder site is still a work in progress and it's not recommended to link to it yet. Please visit http:www.mucoder.net if you want to see the existing site.
