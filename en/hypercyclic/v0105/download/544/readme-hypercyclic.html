<h2>hypercyclic 1.5 - read me</h2><br/>

<h3>Important - before you start</h3>

<ul>
<li><h4>All Platforms</h4></li>

<ul>
<li>if you have been using beta build 1.5.493 and are upgrading to 1.5.496 or higher, you should reset hypercyclic to factory defaults once in order to restore the original factory presets</li>
</ul>

<li><h4>Windows Users</h4></li>
<ul>
<li>When using Ableton Live, keyboard input in the plugin window is disabled by default. This is not controlled by the plugin, but is a default behaviour of Live itself.  You can enable keyboard input to the plugin window by adding the line  "-_EnsureKeyMessagesForPlugins" to a file called Options.txt in the directory c:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Ableton\Live n.n.n\Preferences\. Please see also <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/articles/optionstxt-file-live">https://www.ableton.com/en/articles/optionstxt-file-live/</a></li>
</ul>

<li><h4>Mac Users</h4></li>
<ul>
<li>hypercyclic v1.5 now requires a Mac with Intel processor.</li>
<li>the minimum OS X version required is 10.5, except for the Audio Unit plugin version, which requires 10.6</li>
<li>if you want to use the AU version, you must copy the hypercyclic.component file to your components directory (e.g. to /Users/yourname/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/Components)</li>
<li>if you want to use the VST version, you must copy and rename the hypercyclic.component file to hypercyclic.vst and copy it your vst directory  (e.g. to /Users/yourname/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/VST)</li>
</ul>
<li><h4>Linux users</h4></li>
<ul>
<li>hypercyclic v1.5 requires a 64-bit Linux distribution and when using the plugin version, a 64-bit VST host</li>
<li>if you have a 32-bit Linux host, you can still use the hypercyclic v1.1 version</li>
<li>hypercyclic was tested on Ubuntu Studio 12.04 Precise Pangolin LTS x64.  Other 64-bit distros might work, but your mileage may vary</li>
<li>after unpacking hypercyclic from the downloaded zip, you must set the executable bit on the hypercyclic binary using the command 'chmod +x hypercyclic'</li>
</ul>
</ul>
