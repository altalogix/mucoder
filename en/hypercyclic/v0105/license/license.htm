<p>1. License Agreement.</p>
<p>As used in this Agreement, "Licensor" shall mean Altalogix BVBA, Karel Schurmansstraat 40, 3010 Leuven (Kessel-Lo), Belgium. "Product" shall mean mucoder hypercyclic version 1.1.x</p>
<p>Licensor grants Licensee a non-exclusive and non-transferable license to reproduce and use for personal or internal business purposes, on a single computer and by a single person at a time, the executable code version of the Product, provided any copy must contain all of the original proprietary notices. This license does not entitle Licensee to receive from Licensor hard-copy documentation, technical support, telephone assistance, or enhancements or updates to the Product, although Licensor may decide to provide these anyway. Licensor may terminate this Agreement at any time, for any reason or no reason. Licensor may also terminate this Agreement if Licensee breaches any of its terms and conditions. Upon termination, Licensee shall destroy all copies of the Product and of the personalised license files that were received by Licensee after purchase.</p>

In case Licensee purchased a license to continue using the product and received a personalised license file to unlock the Product, Licensee will ensure that this license file is kept in a secure place and does not fall into the hands of unauthorised users. If a license file is found to be published anywhere this is considered sufficient reason for immediate termination of that license.</p>
